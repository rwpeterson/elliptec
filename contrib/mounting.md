# Tips for mounting elliptec devices

## Low beam height ELL14 motorized rotation mount

A 5 cm beam height (with kinematic base) is possible mounting the ELL14
on its side or upside-down. The rear face accepts SR-series cage rods in
a 30 mm square; these can be mated with ER-series cage rods and mounted
in a cage plate. An RS05P 12.5 mm pedestal post, a 3 mm post spacer, a
KB25 kinematic base, and the cage plate will locate the center of the
SM1 lens tube at 5 cm. For applications that do not require the
kinematic base, shorter beam hights should be possible.

- SR05-P4 Compact cage assembly rod, 1/2" long, Ø4 mm, 4 pack
